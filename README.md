### result-linux-kernel
  * what is that?
    * Result linux kernel is my result of building kernel android. I will push every time i built in this repository or maybe tou can say this is ( archive ) file kernel linux android with format zip. Because i dont use telegram fo check it i made push like this

  * this kernel good?
    * So i don't know im still learning. This kernel i made foe my ( noobs ) experiment

  * what your device?  
    * I have 2 devices for now.

      * oppo
        * -
      * asus
        * ( X00T/X00TD ) for codename and this kernel for X00T/X00TD

  * reason why i make kernel again?
    * I think i like with this situation because i can think how machine can be running. How to process system can be running,stop and killing. Knowing what is kernel for. And have 1 more reason 'because i can't make kernel in device oppo ( i have been research for my oppo device how can i modified "oprek" ) but until now i fon't find it. Maybe oppo its like this ( very hard to modified "oprek" ) or not all device can be modified "oprek

  * can i use your kernel?
    * Of course you can use it. This is open source. Free for download, and install

  * license
